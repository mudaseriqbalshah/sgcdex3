# universal-router-sdk

This SDK facilitates interactions with Universal Router. This repo is the Volrex.Network variation of the original Universal-router-sdk by UniswapLabs. The Volrex.Network implementation makes the necessary changes in order to be compatible with the Volrex.Network smart-router and other existing SDK's.

## Usage

Install latest version of universal-router-sdk. Then import the corresponding Trade class and Data object for each protocol you'd like to interact with.

```sh
npm add @pancakeswap/universal-router-sdk
# or
yarn add @pancakeswap/universal-router-sdk
# or
pnpm add @pancakeswap/universal-router-sdk
```
